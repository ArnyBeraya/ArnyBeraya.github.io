         Day 18-20 Was spent testing the search engine I had to test the search engine to make sure that it was working 
         I also tested it myself by looking for products that I was looking for, such as laptops or a specific brand of laptop 
         Last time I was looking for a laptop it took me 3 days to find a good laptop that was fit for me, I also had to search multiple websites 
         to find the best price and product for me. The picture below is me testing the site
