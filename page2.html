             After the first day which was spent with me watching and searching 
            for the best language to use and tutorials on said languages, I start to
            test the things I learn from these videos I use notepad++ for testing and scripting 
            these languages as I have not yet found out a more efficient way of doing it. The first 
            tests were simple print ("Hello World") line of scripts and simple stuff such as writing paragraphs 
            similar to this one
