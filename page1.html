       In my first day of making my capstone I went on to the internet
        to find the best programming languages to use for the website/tool that 
        I will be making. I found out that the best languages to use is Html, Css, 
        and Java script so I watched multiple videos on the internet this took some time 
        because I watched alot of videos on how to create a website that would work for my 
        capstone but since no one has a tutorial on how to do the exact tool I need I had 
        to watch multiple videos and such and combine the knowledge I have learned from these videos
        to create the tool or website that I needed, Now that I have some basic understanding of 
        what to do I started testing it out. </h2> </font>
