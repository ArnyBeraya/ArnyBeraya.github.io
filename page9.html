         During the 30 days of me making the website I got experience on how to make a website 
        this portfolio itself was made in visual studio code, I learned a lot of good things during this 30 days 
        and the experience I gained from it is something I treasure alot not only was it helpful in teahching me how to make 
        my website for capstone, it also benefitted me by teaching me how to make websites such as this portfolio which was coded thje same 
        way my capstone was coded.
