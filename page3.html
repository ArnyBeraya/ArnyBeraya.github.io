             During the Third and Fourth Day I spent most of these 2 days 
             learning more and testing the things that I had learned from previous days 
             I tried to write more complex scripts and tried to run a website with the said scripts
             although it is still pretty basic this will be the base of everything that will be done 
             in the future.
