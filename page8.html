         Day 21-30 Was spent Sending links out to testers who were people that I knew and that had experience with online shopping 
         these participants were given the links and there were 15 of them in total, the links were given to them for them to use the website/tool 
         so they can evaluate it, after they finish testing the website I then ask them a series of questions that helps in proving that the website 
         was useful and effective.
